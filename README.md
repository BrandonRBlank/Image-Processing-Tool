# Image-Processing-Tool

You don't need no stinkin' $700 photoshop to add intensity, or binarize, or scale images, or convert to grey, or apply blur, or perform histogram equalization, or use sobel edge detection, or canny edge detection, when you've got my Image Processing Tool.

That's right handsome, you can use this tool, written in Visual C++, to do all that, for F R E E!
